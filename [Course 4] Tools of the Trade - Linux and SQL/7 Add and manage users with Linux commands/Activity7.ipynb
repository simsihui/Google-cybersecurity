    "# Activity: Add and manage users with Linux commands\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this lab, youâ€™ll learn how to add and manage user access in a system. These skills can be used when working with authentication technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tasks:**\n",
    "* Add a new employee\n",
    "* Change ownership of a file\n",
    "* Add the new employee to a new group\n",
    "* Delete the employee from the system\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Task 1. Add a new user**\n",
    "A new employee has joined the Research department. In this task, you must add them to the system. The username assigned to them is `researcher9`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a command to add a user called `researcher9` to the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * `sudo useradd researcher9`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Next, you need to add the new user to the research_team group.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `sudo usermod -g research_team researcher9`\n",
    "\n",
    "Could have done both:\n",
    "`sudo useradd researcher9 -g research_team`\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Task 2. Assign file ownership**\n",
    "To allow `researcher9` to be the owner of `project_r.txt` file:\n",
    "  * `sudo chown researcher9 /home/researcher2/projects/project_r.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Task 3. Add the user to a secondary group**\n",
    "A couple of months later, this employee's role at the organization has changed, and they are working in both the Research and the Sales departments.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, you must add researcher9 to a secondary group (`sales_team`). Their primary group is still `research_team`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `sudo usermod -a -G sales_team researcher9`\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Task 4. Delete a user**\n",
    "A year later, `researcher9`, decided to leave the company. In this task, you must remove them from the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `sudo userdel researcher9`\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes an output like the following will appear:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Userdel: Group researcher9 not removed because it is not the primary group of user researcher9.`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** *When you create a new user in Linux, a group with the same name as the user is automatically created and the user is the only member of that group. After removing users, it is good practice to clean up any such empty groups that may remain behind.*\n",
    "\n",
    "* `sudo groupdel researcher9`\n",
    "\n",
