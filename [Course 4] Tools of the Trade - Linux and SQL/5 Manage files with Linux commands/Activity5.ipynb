    "# Activity: Manage files with Linux commands\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Learn how to manage and modify files in a Linux file structure. You’ll use Linux commands in the Bash shell to complete these steps. You’ll also use the nano text editor to add text to a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tasks:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a new directory\n",
    "* Remove a directory\n",
    "* Move a file and delete a file\n",
    "* Create a file and add text using nano\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Task 1. Create a new directory**\n",
    "1. Create a new subdirectory called `logs` in the `/home/analyst` directory.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   * Type and Enter `mkdir logs` (since you are already in the respective directory)\n",
    "     * use `pwd` and `ls` to verify\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Task 2. Remove a directory**\n",
    "1. Remove the `/home/analyst/temp` directory.\n",
    "   * Type and Enter: `rmdir temp`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. List the contents of the `/home/analyst` directory to confirm that you have removed the `temp` subdirectory.\n",
    "   * Type and Enter: `ls` to verify\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Task 3. Move a file**\n",
    "The `Q3patches.txt` file contains notes taken on third-quarter patches and is now in the correct reporting format. You must move the  `Q3patches.txt` file from the `notes` directory to the `reports` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Navigate to the `/home/analyst/notes` directory\n",
    "   * Type and Enter: `cd notes`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Move the `Q3patches.txt` file from the `/home/analyst/notes` directory to the `/home/analyst/reports` directory.\n",
    "   * Type and Enter: `mv permissions.txt /home/analyst/logs`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. List the contents of the `/home/analyst/reports directory` to confirm that you have moved the file successfully.\n",
    "   * Type and Enter: `ls /home/analyst/reports`\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Task 4. Remove a file**\n",
    "Next, you must delete an unused file called `tempnotes.txt` from the `/home/analyst/notes` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Remove the `tempnotes.txt` file from the `/home/analyst/notes` directory.\n",
    "   * Type and Enter: `rm tempnotes.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. List the contents of the `/home/analyst/notes` directory to confirm that you’ve removed the file successfully.\n",
    "   * Type and Enter: `ls`\n",
    "\n",
    "No files should be listed in the `notes` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Task 5. Create a new file**\n",
    "Now, you must create a file named `tasks.txt` in the `/home/analyst/notes` directory that you’ll use to document completed tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To create an empty file called `tasks.txt` in the `/home/analyst/notes` directory.\n",
    "    * Type and Enter: `touch tasks.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. List the contents of the `/home/analyst/notes` directory to verify.\n",
    "   * Type and Enter: `ls`\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Task 6. Edit a file**\n",
    "Finally, you must use the nano text editor to edit the `tasks.txt` file and add a note describing the tasks you’ve completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using the nano text editor, open the `tasks.txt` file that is located in the `/home/analyst/notes` directory.\n",
    "   * Type and Enter: `nano tasks.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Copy and paste the following text into the text input area of the nano editor and press **CTRL + O** to save and **CTRL + X** to exit the nano text editor.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Then **CTRL + C** to clear Bash shell window and remove any traces of the nano text input area.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Note**: Most Bash shells typically handle the screen cleanup after you exit nano. In this lab environment, nano sometimes leaves some text clutter around the edges of the screen that the clear command cleans up for you.*\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Display the contents of the `tasks.txt` file to confirm that it contains the updated task details.\n",
    "   * Type and Enter: `cat tasks.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Great work!\n",
    "\n",
    "You now have practical experience in using basic Linux Bash shell commands to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* create and remove directories,\n",
    "* copy, move, and remove files, and\n",
    "* edit files with the nano text editor.\n",
    "\n",
    "You’re well on your way to managing directories and files in a Linux environment!"
