    "# Activity Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab activity, you’ll use the Advanced Package Tool (APT) and sudo to install and uninstall applications in a Linux Bash shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll use Suricata and tcpdump as an example. These are network security applications that can be used to capture and analyze network traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "### __Task 1: Ensure that APT is installed__\n",
    "First, you’ll check that the APT application is installed so that you can use it to manage applications. The simplest way to do this is to run the apt command in the Bash shell and check the response.\n",
    "\n",
    " _Prompt is represented by ~$_\n",
    "\n",
    "* Type `apt` after command-line prompt and press ENTER\n",
    "\n",
    "When installed, apt displays basic usage information when you run it. This includes the version information and a description of the tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### __Task 2. Install and uninstall the Suricata application__\n",
    "In this task, you must install Suricata, a network analysis tool used for intrusion detection, and verify that it installed correctly. Then, you’ll uninstall the application.\n",
    "Use the APT package manager to install the Suricata application.\n",
    "* Type `sudo apt install suricata` and ENTER to **install**\n",
    "  * When prompted to continue, press the ENTER key to respond with the default response, **Y**. (In this case, the default response is Yes.)\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Type `suricata` to verify it is installed\n",
    "\n",
    "* Type `sudo apt remove suricata` and ENTER to **unstall**\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### __Task 3. Install the tcpdump application__\n",
    "In this task, you must install the tcpdump application. This is a command-line tool that can be used to capture network traffic in a Linux Bash shell. \n",
    "\n",
    "Use the APT package manager to install tcpdump.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Type `sudo apt install tcpdump` and press ENTER.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### __Task 4. List the installed applications__\n",
    "Next, you need to confirm that you’ve installed the required applications. It's important to be able to validate that the correct applications are installed. Often you may want to check that the correct versions are installed as well.\n",
    " \n",
    "Use the APT package manager to list all installed applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Type `apt list --installed` and press ENTER.\n",
    "\n",
    "This produces a long list of applications because Linux has a lot of software installed by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "Search through the list to find the `tcpdump` application you installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Great work!\n",
    "\n",
    "You now have practical experience with the APT package manager. You learned to:\n",
    "* install applications,\n",
    "* uninstall applications, and\n",
    "* list installed applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being able to manage installed applications in Linux is a key skill for any security analyst.\n",
    "\n"
