    "# Activity: Manage authorization\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this lab, you’ll learn how to examine and manage file permissions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Authorization is the concept of granting access to specific resources in a system. It's important because without authorization any user could access and modify all files belonging to other users or system files. This would certainly be a security risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a security analyst, setting appropriate access permissions is critical to protecting sensitive information and maintaining the overall security of a system.\n",
    "\n",
    "*These skills can be used when configuring user authorization. You’ll use Linux commands in the Bash shell to complete this lab.*\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tasks:**\n",
    "1. Check permissions for files in a directory\n",
    "2. Check for incorrect file permissions and change permissions as needed\n",
    "3. Remove unauthorized access to a directory\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Task 1. Check file and directory details**\n",
    "The lab starts with `/home/researcher2` as the current working directory as you're changing permissions for files and directories belonging to the `researcher2` user.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Navigate to the projects directory.\n",
    "* `cd projects`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. List the contents and permissions of the projects directory.\n",
    "* `ls -l` : shows permissions for all visible \n",
    "* `ls -la` : shows permissions for all visible and hidden\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Check whether any hidden files exist in the projects directory.\n",
    "* `ls -a` : shows all files and directories including hidden ones\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Task 2. Change file permissions**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, you must determine whether any files have incorrect permissions and then change the permissions as needed. This action will remove unauthorized access and strengthen security on the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "None of the files should allow the other users to write to files.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Check whether any files in the projects directory have write permissions for the owner type of **other**.\n",
    "* `ls -la`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Change the permissions of the file identified in the previous step so that the owner type of other doesn’t have write permissions.\n",
    "* `chmod o-w project_k.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** *Permissions are granted for three different types of owners, namely user, group, and other.*\n",
    "\n",
    "In the chmod command:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `u` sets the permissions for the user who owns the file\n",
    "  * `g` sets the permissions for the group that owns the file\n",
    "  * `o` sets the permissions for others.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Task 3. Change file permissions on a hidden file**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, you must determine if a hidden file has incorrect permissions and then change the permissions as needed. This action will further remove unauthorized access and strengthen security on the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Check the permissions of the hidden file `.project_x.txt`\n",
    "  * `ls -la`\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "`-rw--w---- 1 researcher2 research_team   46 Jan  4 07:28 .project_x.txt\n",
    "`\n",
    "\n",
    "This means the user and the group has written permission.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Change the permissions of the file `.project_x.txt` so that both the user and the group can read, but not write to, the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `chmod u=r,g=r .project_x.txt` OR `chmod u-w,g-w,g+r .project_x.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "Overwrites.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "`-r--r----- 1 researcher2 research_team   46 Jan  4 07:28 .project_x.txt`\n",

    "\n",
    "## **Task 4. Change directory permissions**\n",
    "\n",
    "Only the `researcher2` user should be allowed to access the `drafts` directory and its contents. (This means that only `researcher2` should have execute privileges.)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Check the permissions of the `drafts` directory.\n",
    "* `ls -l`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Remove the execute permission for the group from the `drafts` directory.\n",
    "* `chmod g-x drafts/`\n"
