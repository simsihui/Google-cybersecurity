    "# Activity: Filter with grep\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you’ll learn how to use the `grep` command and **piping** = `|` to search for files and return specific information. You’ll get information from different files, including server log files and user data files. You’ll use Linux commands in the Bash shell to complete these steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you’ll do:**\n",
    "1. Search for error messages in a file\n",
    "2. Search for files that contain a specific string\n",
    "3. Search for information in user files\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Task 1. Search for error messages in a log file**\n",
    "navigate to the `/home/analyst/logs` directory and report on the error messages in the `server_logs.txt` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "*  `cd logs` to navigate to the `/home/analyst/logs` directory\n",
    "   * My ans : `cd /home/analyst/logs`\n",
    "*  `grep error server_logs.txt`: to sieve through the entire data/text to return \"error\"\n",
    "   *  My ans : `cat server_log.txt | grep error `\n",
    "   * My ans : `cat server_log.txt | grep error | wc -l `: to return no. of documents containing \"error\"\n",
    "  \n",
    "Note: `ls /home/analyst/logs | grep server`: helps to sieve through all the files inside `logs` folder to get all documents with the word \"server\" \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Task 2. Find files containing specific strings**\n",
    "navigate to the `/home/analyst/reports/users` directory and search for user data files that contain a **specific string in their names**.\n",
    "\n",
    "*  `cd /home/analyst/reports/users` to navigate to the respective directory\n",
    "  \n",
    "* `ls | grep Q1` : since we are already in the subdirectory\n",
    "  * My ans: `ls /home/analyst/reports/users | grep Q1 `: to list only files containing \"Q1\"\n",
    "* `ls | grep access`\n",
    "  * *My ans: `ls /home/analyst/reports/users | grep access | wc -l `: to count how many files contain \"access\" in their names.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "*Not covered in the course\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Task 3. Search more file contents**\n",
    "Search for information contained in user files and report on users that were added and deleted from the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `ls` : Display the files in the `/home/analyst/reports/users `directory\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. `grep jhill Q2_deleted_users.txt` : Search the `Q2_deleted_users.txt` file for the username `jhill`\n",
    "   \n",
    "   * My ans: `cat Q2_deleted_users.txt | grep jhill `\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `grep \"Human Resources\" Q4_added_users.txt` : To search the `Q4_added_users.txt` file to list the users who were added to the `Human Resources` department\n",
    "\n",
    "    * _**Note:** In order for grep to interpret a string of two or more words correctly, you must add quotations (\"Human Resources\")._\n",
    "\n",

    "# Conclusion\n",

    "Great work!\n",

    "You now have practical experience in using `grep` to:\n",

    "* search for specific information contained in files, and\n",
    "  \n",
    "* find files containing specific strings that were piped into `grep`.\n",

    "You’re well on your way to using fundamental tools in Linux to filter the information you need.\n",
